                    So what does Marshall McLuhan mean when saying "The Medium Is the Message"? 
                    It's not that the content of the message is irrelevant, but rather that the 
                    way in which we send & receive messages are much more important. With the advent 
                    of technologies like the internet and its various social platforms, have changed 
                    the way we behave. An immediate example to this would be how the change of the 
                    primary form of communication from oral conversations to printed words made us 
                    utilize our visual sense more than our hearing sense.

                <p>
                    In modern day, with the internet as our medium, we have created new styles of 
                    communicating with one another. We now utilize internet slang such as "lol" and 
                    emojis to share our thoughts with one another. It has also given us a facade to 
                    hide behind because our real emotions and thoughts are hidden behind these lines 
                    of text, creating a false sense of security for the other party.

                    In a sense, Donald Trump has successfully imprinted this idea to his supporters through 
                    his labelling of 'fake news' during his reign as President of the United States. The 
                    distrust between the media (the medium) and the citizens (the consumers) are at an all 
                    time high. The actual news (the content) is no longer the focus as people will always 
                    hold the idea of "fake news" in their heads in some type of form whenever they tune in 
                    to the news.

                    A personal example regarding behavior on social media, I feel obligated to reply with 
                    a "lol" to something that was sent to me even if I do not find it humourous or if I'm 
                    in a bad mood. Vice versa, receiving a simple 'lol' reply would make me feel more comfortable 
                    about not having wasted the other person's time. Of course this doesn't mean that prior to 
                    the invention of internet people didn't put on a front in the presence of one another, but 
                    the tendency and ease of doing so definitely changed.

                    McLuhan mentions how the future medium will be "One big gossip column that is unforgiving, 
                    unforgetful and from which there is no redemption". This reminded me of the Black Lives Matter 
                    movement that occured a couple months back. During the height of the movement, some former student 
                    at my former high school decided to dig up all posts and comments of other former students that had 
                    any hints of racial discrimination. From people calling each other "monkey" to others using the 
                    "n-word", no one was spared unless they formally and publically "apologize". To put it simply "cancel 
                    culture" happened and the witch hunt did nothing to help the movement and instead only made 
                    the real racists hide in the shadow while making people afraid of what is allowed to be said online.

                        “When I first came on the scene, in 1990, no one talked about McLuhan — it was as if he had never existed, 
                        and when I spoke about him there was no traction,” Camille Paglia, professor of English at the University 
                        of the Arts in Philadelphia, told the New York Times in 2000.
